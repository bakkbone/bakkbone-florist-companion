== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is the plugin well-documented? =

We believe so! Check it out [here](https://docs.floristpress.org/).

= What plugins do I need? =

* [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)

= What plugins/themes are compatible/integrated?

Check the current listing in our documentation: [Third Party Compatibility](https://docs.floristpress.org/3pc/)

= The plugin/theme I want to use isn't compatible, what do I do?

We recommend a double-headed approach:

First, open a topic on [Canny](https://floristpress.canny.io/), so we can investigate whether it's a quick fix and demonstrate there's interest for the feature.

Then, reach out to the plugin or theme's developer and ask them to integrate with us. Feel free to use (or modify) this template for contacting them:

`I've requested integration with __________ and FloristPress via their Canny at https://floristpress.canny.io/. The FloristPress volunteer team is happy to work with developers wherever they can, plus they welcome both issues and pull requests on GitHub. If your integration requires a hook to be added, just let them know – they can probably add it! Drop them a line at developers@floristpress.org and let them know how they can help – or feel free to interact on Canny. For plugins, they also highly recommend adding a "BKF tested up to" header to your plugin/theme, and you can add a "BKF requires at least" header if needed – these are honoured in v3.2.0 onwards.`

= How do I request or upvote a feature? =

If there's a feature missing, please let us know on [Canny](https://floristpress.canny.io/) - we'd love to hear your feedback and know what you want to see added next!

= How do I get support? =

If the plugin isn't functioning as it should, please use the [support forum here on the WordPress.org Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bakkbone-florist-companion/).
